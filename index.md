## **Project History**

---
* We first got a Raspberry Pi from Mr. Andrade named **Michael**, unfortunately, it was not up to our standard, so we got another one (owned by Dylan, my partner), the same model but **younger and more handsome**, named **Michael 2.0**
* We then tried to install **Volumio OS** (An operating system specifically made for audio and music playing) into Michael 2.0, but that means we need **more monitors and Micro SD Cards**, which also means that it is going to be **super tedious and makes the project more expensive**, we do not want that
* We decided to embed a **Python script** into Michael 2.0 instead, which with the help of **buttons and wires**, we successfully created a Walkman, though in this case, **Sitman**, because no one wanted to walk around with the setup, We tried, learned it the hard way
